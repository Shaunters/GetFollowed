[:br: - Vers√£o BR](./translations/br.md)

## Social medias supported (until now):
- üê¶ Twitter;
- üì∑ Instagram

## How to use?
Before we start, you got to have [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
After the installation, clone or download this repo, and in the main folder, use `cd src`,
then use `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and you can proceed.

Before starting the script, see in the the section above if the social media you'd like to use is supported by the script, and search for an tab like "people that might interest you" or somethink related.

Then start the script, by clicking on it, or using `python main.py` in the `src` folder.
When the script is started, it will ask you what social media you're going to use, you have to choose between the options using the number of the option you want, after that, an 5 seconds timer will begin, you should return to the social media page and wait. The script will automatically click on the "follow" button, and if don't find it, it will scroll down automatically. (Very easy, isn't it?)
